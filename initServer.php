/*===============================
/ The "main" function of this file is init_server()
/ It's purpose is to connect to an existing(!) db and check whether all required tables are existing
/ Or to create the missing tables
/ Other functions are added for readability and modularity
/ Note that if you have checked out the git repo you STILL NEED to manually create the mysql.conf file !
/ It has to contain the following exact syntax: "username \n servername \n password \n dbName"
/ (Without quotes and substituting each value with your own configuration. servername refers to domain or ip (probably localhost)
/ Understand that you have to MANUALLY create the db before executing this script !
